TODO

Fix transport work calculations: it's proportional to   tkm / truck_capacity

Check work calculations: biomass_ratio is in heat, why use % capacity ?

Benefits depends on time -> return a vector

Use npv, get rid of benefitaddup

Get rid of old code in emission.py

Define FTE as a display unit of time

SupplyChain sizing check invariance to repeat calls

Check emission calculation against CDM ACM0085 methodology

Generate figures in EPS format (or SVG or PDF) and adjust the Makefile

Encapsulate the class

Read data from data file - separate primary data processing from secondary data input by an intermediate secondary data file

Write a test that check CofiringPowerPlant with 0% biomass ratio yields same results as PowerPlant

Use decorator to set display_unit of results

Simpler call parent constructor in CofiringPlant constructor

Sensitivity analysis

Consider more indicators that LCOE:
  Debt Service Coverage Ratio (requires Cash Flow Available for Debt Service ) - minimum over all periods and average
  Project Internal Rate of Return, pre-tax
  Equity Internal Rate of Return


DONE

Cleanup the * time_step -- values in vectors are "amount during the period", not intensities

Add transport emissions to SupplyChain

move CofiringPlant.biomass_*() methods into class SupplyChain

straw_burned_infield  depends on time -> return a vector 

Rename the tables meaningfully (add legend keywords after number)

Pass boiler_efficiency_loss function as an initialization parameter

rename units.py

Transport_tkm  depends on time -> returns a vector

Add smokestack and controls to PowerPlant class

Use a list or an array rather than a function for time-dependant variables

Check in tables 7 and 8 that emissions in the new code match the old code

store emissions factors in a dictionary

Unify the interface in CofiringPlant: Coal_Used() is a method but Biomass_Used is a member

Recode biomasscost.py

Setup  git  to collaborate

Amortization within the first 10 year

Change print files to tables

Use (standard) test harness

Add README

Use function to print table for both cases

Use (standard) software construction

Get units right
  Monetary units in Table A, B

Redo the doc test 

"PrintWithUnits" function for testing

Typo in yield

Refactoring the model to fix the zero biomass percentage bug

Add modules as necessary to compute intermediate values like coal saved or collection radius

Hourly dispatch, with ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, maintenance downtime, and variable electricity price --> WONTFIX, different model
