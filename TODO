TODO

Check emissions in the 0% biomass ratio

Fix transport work calculations

store emissions factors in a dictionary

Check emission calculation against CDM ACM0002 methodology

Generate figures in EPS format (or SVG or PDF) and adjust the Makefile

Use a list or an array rather than a function for time-dependant variables

Encapsulate the class

Read data from data file

Use decorator to set display_unit of results

Simpler call parent constructor in CofiringPlant constructor

Sensitivity analysis

Cleanup the *timestep and clarify time units (period or year)

Consider more indicators that LCOE:
  Debt Service Coverage Ratio (requires Cash Flow Available for Debt Service ) - minimum over all periods and average
  Project Internal Rate of Return, pre-tax
  Equity Internal Rate of Return


DONE

Recode biomasscost.py

Setup  git  to collaborate

Amortization within the first 10 year

Change print files to tables

Use (standard) test harness

Add README

Use function to print table for both cases

Use (standard) software construction

Get units right
  Monetary units in Table A, B

Redo the doc test 

"PrintWithUnits" function for testing

Typo in yield

Refactoring the model to fix the zero biomass percentage bug

Add modules as necessary to compute intermediate values like coal saved or collection radius

Hourly dispatch, with ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, maintenance downtime, and variable electricity price --> WONTFIX, different model
