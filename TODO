Fix transport work calculations: it's proportional to   tkm / truck_capacity

Check work calculations: biomass_ratio is in heat, why use % capacity ?

Benefits depends on time -> return a vector

Use npv, get rid of benefitaddup

Check emission calculation against CDM ACM0085 methodology

Generate figures in EPS format (or SVG or PDF) and adjust the Makefile

Read data from data file - separate primary data processing from secondary data input by an intermediate secondary data file

Write a test that check CofiringPowerPlant with 0% biomass ratio yields same results as PowerPlant

Use decorator to set display_unit of results

Simpler call parent constructor in CofiringPlant constructor

Sensitivity analysis

Consider more indicators that LCOE:
  Debt Service Coverage Ratio (requires Cash Flow Available for Debt Service ) - minimum over all periods and average
  Project Internal Rate of Return, pre-tax
  Equity Internal Rate of Return
