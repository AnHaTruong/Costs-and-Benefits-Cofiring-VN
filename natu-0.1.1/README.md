**Natural units in Python**

**Warning:** This project is currently in a pre-release state.  It will be
officially released once the unit tests are complete.

[natu] is a free, open-source package to represent physical quantities.  There are
[many Python packages that deal with units and quantities](http://kdavies4.github.io/natu/seealso.html),
but [natu] is uniquely system-independent.  The units are derived from physical
constants with adjustable values and dimensions.  The value of a unit is
factored into a quantity so that the quantity is not "in" any particular unit.
This has the following advantages:

- **Flexible**: Different unit systems, including [natural units] (hence the
  name "natu"), can be represented by simply adjusting the
  [base physical constants].
- **Simple**: Unit conversion is inherent.  This results in quick computations
  and a small code base (about 1500 lines).  By default, dimensions and display
  units are tracked to catch errors and for string formatting.  This can be
  disabled to nearly eliminate the computational overhead while still providing
  the core features.
- **Intuitive**: Each unit is a fixed quantity that is treated as a mathematical
  entity.  A variable quantity is expressed as the product of a number and a
  unit, as stated by [BIPM].
- **Representative**: The design reflects the way modern units are defined.
  Standards organizations such as [NIST] assign values to universal physical
  constants so that the values of units can be determined by physical
  experiments instead of prototypes.
- **Scalable**: The values of the base physical constants can scaled to prevent
  exponent overflow, regardless of the units used.


For example, you can do this:

    >>> from natu.units import degC, K
    >>> 0*degC + 100*K
    100.0 degC
