Blending biomass with fossil fuels is a relatively low-cost technology to use renewable energy in the electricity generation sector. Most coal power plants can co-fire a small fraction (<10% energy) of biomass without major retrofit. In high income countries, over a hundred of power plants cofire biomass, often because governments forced utilities to deliver a minimum fraction of their electricity from renewable sources. Would that technology be appropriate in a middle income country on a coal binge: Vietnam? Here we show that the costs of cofiring 5% rice straw with coal are relatively modest, presenting two cases where the levelized cost of electricity would increase by less than 1%. These costs are lower than the benefits accruing to farmers selling straw to the plant and neighbors benefiting from improved air quality. Assuming a carbon value of 1$/tCO2, the value of avoided CO2 is small in front of agricultural and air quality benefits.


RequisiteÂ :
Python 3
pandas
natu (provided, patched)
sudo pip3 install xlrd
sudo pip3 install SALib

natu:
We patched the file natu/core.py using the provided diff to remove the dependency on reduce()

Known bugs and workarounds:

doctest fails in an spyder3 IPython console with an unexpected argument in __init__
See https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1855
Use a simple Python console instead.

install the pre-commit script to always run the tests before commit
ln pre-commit .git/hooks/


Quality programming goals
1. Zero code duplicates using codacy 
2. Zero issues regarding PEP8 compliance using  codacy  (with reasonable number of tests enabled)

Four kinds of testing:
0. Self testing with  assert  statements
1. Unit testing with  doctests  comments in the code
2. Function testing with ad hoc python scripts
3. Regression testing with the  Makefile
4. System testing (TODO): by reproducing previously published results using their cost numbers
