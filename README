Blending biomass with fossil fuels is a relatively low-cost technology to use renewable energy in the electricity generation sector. Most coal power plants can co-fire a small fraction (<10% energy) of biomass without major retrofit. In high income countries, over a hundred of power plants cofire biomass, often because governments forced utilities to deliver a minimum fraction of their electricity from renewable sources. Would that technology be appropriate in a middle income country on a coal binge: Vietnam? Here we show that the costs of cofiring 5% rice straw with coal are relatively modest, presenting two cases where the levelized cost of electricity would increase by less than 1%. These costs are lower than the benefits accruing to farmers selling straw to the plant and neighbors benefiting from improved air quality. Assuming a carbon value of 1$/tCO2, the value of avoided CO2 is small in front of agricultural and air quality benefits.


RequisiteÂ :
Python 3
pandas
natu (provided, patched)
sudo pip3 install xlrd
sudo pip3 install SALib

natu:
We patched the file natu/core.py using the provided diff to remove the dependency on reduce()

Known bugs and workarounds:

doctest fails in an spyder3 IPython console with an unexpected argument in __init__
See https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1855
Use a simple Python console instead.
